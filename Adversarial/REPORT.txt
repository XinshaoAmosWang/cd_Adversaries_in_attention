*****Report of working state******
1. Works for original overfeat network 
	1. works in generate mode 
		- unit batch and larger
		- gpumode and cpumode
	2. works in evaluate mode 
		- unit batch and larger
		- gpumode and cpumode
2. Works for general case (CUBS) 
	1. works in generate mode
		- NOT in unit batch mode: something to do with the network mostly
		- works in larger batch sizes
		- works in gpumode and cpumode
	2. works in evaluate mode
		- NOT in unit batch mode: something to do with the network mostly
		- works in larger batch sizes
		- works in gpumode and cpumode

*Imp notes*
This error is weird: observed it once and now haven't seen it.
Keeping it for future checks
The table.unpack function returns a TABLE when it is a SUBSET else it unpacks as an ARRAY
Hence, if the batchsize = tablesize extra {} required; else no extra {} required

*Milestones*
1. models to be shared (all 4 or more)
2. the variable during the fwd run to be shared (via global variable maybe)
3. fwd and bkwd run for comparison at different epsilons
4. Tests in mind:
-- test adv at different epsilons (generated and evaluated using both the models) - test on both the train and test set
-- histogram of the confidence scores on the test set (for 0 epsilon and others)
-- *visualize the images for adversaries (mainly for CUBS) - more detailed analysis required*
5. Imagenet tests
-- *Evaluate on val set without any adversarial noise (get numbers to confirm correctness) - test with multiple crops and top-5 error*
-- *Get the histogram of confidence scores on val set*
-- *Evaluate with adversarial noise on ImagNet val set and get histogram of confidence scores*

ImageNet-Dense Evaluation at a single scale
-- Change the fully-connected layers to convolutional ones (f.s. 7x7, 1x1, 1x1)
-- Change the weight format from fc to conv (output_features x input_features x <kernel size>)
-- Keep dense convolution with a step_size=1 and padding=acc. to the kernel
-- Try with cropped image evaluation, conv should yield same results as with fc setup
