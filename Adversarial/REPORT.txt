2. Works for general case (CUBS) 
	1. works in generate mode
		- NOT in unit batch mode: something to do with the network mostly

*Imp notes*
This error is weird: observed it once and now haven't seen it.
Keeping it for future checks
The table.unpack function returns a TABLE when it is a SUBSET else it unpacks as an ARRAY
Hence, if the batchsize = tablesize extra {} required; else no extra {} required

1. models to be shared (all 4 or more)
2. the variable during the fwd run to be shared (via global variable maybe)
3. fwd and bkwd run for comparison at different epsilons
4. Tests in mind:
-- test adv at different epsilons (generated and evaluated using both the models)
-- histogram of the confidence scores on the test set (for 0 epsilon and others)
